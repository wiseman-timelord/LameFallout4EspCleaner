# LameFallout4EspCleaner
Its an iffy Esp cleaner for Windows 7-8.1, because PACT is Windows 10-11

Description:
Its lame becaue you have to give it full control, it must press enter on the active window when it pops up, and it assumes FO4Edit will be loaded within 3s, which it useually is, AND it only works in 1 thread, however its a means to an end for batch auto-cleaning Falout 4 Esps on Windows 7-8.1, because obviously if you are on Windows 10-11, then you should be using PACT.

Development:
This program may be improved upon later.
