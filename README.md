# LameFallout4EspCleaner
Its an iffy Esp cleaner for Windows 7-8.1, because PACT is Windows 10-11

### Description:
Its lame becaue you have to give it full control, it must press enter on the active window when it pops up, and it assumes FO4Edit will be loaded within 3s, which it useually is, AND it only works in 1 thread, however its a means to an end for batch auto-cleaning Falout 4 Esps on Windows 7-8.1, because obviously if you are on Windows 10-11, then you should be using PACT.

## Instructions:
1) Put the extracted files in a sensible location/folder, then put ~"FO4Edit 4.1.5f.zip" in the same folder as the scripts.
2) Run the batch as Admin, and then select the installer, type in your Fallout 4 full path, then from the following menu try option 3s first (This is how long after launch it will attempt to click OK, a slower machine will require longer).
3) Returning to the batch menu, run the main program, at which point the auto-cleaner will start. 

### Notation:
- You are advised to play a 1-2hr movie on the second display if you have one, then run the main program, allowing the autoclean to do its thing, or otherwise on single monitor computer, do some chors/housework leaving the machine alone to work. Worst case scenario it will be pressing enter on other focused windows, and not have pressed enter in autoclean, halting the process.

## Development:
This program may be improved upon later.
